I am Chinthaka Abeyrathne from Sri Lanka, currently pursuing my B.Sc. (Hons) in Engineering, specializing in Electrical and Information Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Ruhuna. I have a passion for self-directed learning and continually seek to expand my knowledge base.

During my internship as a trainee electronics engineer at Vega Innovation (Ltd), I delved into embedded systems and develop my programming skills in languages such as C and C++. This experience has equipped me with a strong foundation in hardware-oriented development.In addition, I have a strong interest in web development technologies such as WordPress, JavaScript, and React. Beyond my technical pursuits, I find joy in creative endeavors such as photo editing, video editing, and UI/UX design.

Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / WordPress / C / C++ / Python
